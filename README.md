# OASIS INFOBYTE Internship (February 2025)

## Task Assignments

### **Task 1: Iris Flower Classification**
Iris flowers are classified into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** based on their measurements. The objective of this task is to train a **machine learning model** that can learn from these measurements and classify the iris species accurately.

Although **Scikit-learn** provides an inbuilt dataset for iris classification, you can also download a similar dataset from external sources to perform the classification using **Machine Learning** techniques.

### **Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python**
Unemployment is measured by the **unemployment rate**, which is the percentage of unemployed individuals within the total labor force.

With the significant rise in unemployment rates during **COVID-19**, this project aims to analyze unemployment trends and derive insights using **data science techniques**.

---

### **Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning**
Car prices are influenced by multiple factors, including:
- Brand goodwill
- Features of the car
- Horsepower and mileage
- Market demand and more

This task involves training a **Machine Learning model** to predict car prices based on historical data and key influencing factors.

---

### **Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning**
Spam emails, also known as **junk mail**, are mass-distributed emails that often contain scams, phishing attempts, or irrelevant content.

This project focuses on building an **email spam detector** using **Python and Machine Learning** to classify emails as **spam** or **non-spam** with high accuracy.

---

### **Task 5: Sales Prediction using Python**
Sales prediction helps businesses estimate the future sales of a product based on factors such as:
- Advertising expenditure
- Target audience segmentation
- Marketing platform used

This project involves building a **Machine Learning model** to predict sales and assist businesses in optimizing their marketing strategies effectively.
